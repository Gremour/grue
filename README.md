Go UI lib based on [pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel)

This is still work in progress. Expect proper examples and tutorial
after basic functionality is implemented (v0.1.0+).

Basic functionality TODO:

- Fonts;
- Layout helper;
- Panel and pushbutton displaying image and/or text;
- Themes and bitmap background for pushbuttons and panels.
